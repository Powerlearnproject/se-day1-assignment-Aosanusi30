#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering applies engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software. These softs help humans in performing tasks and make our life easier. 
Software engineering plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Milestones include the development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C), the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s, the advent of structured programming in the 1970s, 
 the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  - Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
  - Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
  - Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  - Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  - Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
  - Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall Methodology
- Linear approach: Tasks completed in sequence, one phase after another.
- Strict documentation and planning: Detailed specifications and requirements gather before development.
- Changes are costly and time-consuming: Once a phase is completed, it's difficult to make adjustments.
Best suited for: Stable requirements, large-scale projects, and projects with low risk of change.

Agile Methodology
-Iterative and incremental approach: Development occurs in short cycles, with frequent feedback and revisions.
-Flexible and adaptive: Changes can be made easily and quickly, based on feedback from stakeholders.
-Collaborative and team-based: Teams work closely together to deliver results.
Best suited for: Complex requirements, changing requirements, and projects with high risk of change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  - Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
  - Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
  - Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
  - Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
  - Version Control Systems (VCS): Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
  - Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
  - Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
  - Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.

Strategies for Overcoming Challenges: 
Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  - Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
  - Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
  - System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
  - Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

Importance of Quality Control: 
Quality control measures such as code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models

Improves Accuracy: Well-crafted prompts help AI models produce more accurate and relevant outputs by clearly defining the context and desired outcome.
Enhances Usability: Effective prompt engineering makes AI tools more user-friendly, enabling users to get the desired results with minimal effort.
Reduces Ambiguity: Clear and specific prompts minimize misunderstandings and ambiguities, leading to more coherent and useful responses.
Optimizes Performance: By guiding the AI model effectively, prompt engineering can optimize the performance of the model, making it more efficient and reliable.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
'Translate this words to French' - Vague Prompt 
The above does not tell the AI exactly what to translate to French

Translate this words to French 'Good Morning' 
The statement 'good morning' tells the AI what to translate to French unlike the first statement that do not give the AI what to translate.
